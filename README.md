# type-vein
Strictly typed data framework for consuming HTTP services

## getting started

To get started one can open the "test" folder and look at e.g. getting-started.spec.ts.
The tests there are creating the data types and then using the select syntax to make a selection
consisting of these complex types. Once you understand the easy example in the "getting-started.spec.ts"
feel free to move to a more advanced stuff in the other test files.

While going through the tests be carefull as once you go typed, theres no way back. No more typos, no more late night releases etc.
