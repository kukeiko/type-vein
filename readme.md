# type-vein
Strictly typed data framework for consuming HTTP services.

This library is WIP and not yet usable.

## purpose
The goal is to create a library that provides:
- a common interface to execute CRUD operations, no matter where your data is accessed from
- strict typing of your data, so that errors are caught during compilation
- caching to reduce HTTP calls, which also allows developers to choose a more functional programming approach

## usage
as of now all you can do is clone and run the tests, so that'll be
```
npm i
npm test
```
